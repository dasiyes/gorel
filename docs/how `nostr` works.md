# How does Nostr work?

* There are two components: clients and **relays**. Each user runs a client. *Anyone* can run a **relay**.

* Every user is identified by a public key. Every post is signed. Every client validates these signatures.

* Clients fetch data from **relays** of their choice and publish data to other relays of their choice. **A relay doesn't talk to another relay**, only directly to users.

* For example, to "follow" someone a user just instructs their client to query the relays it knows for posts from that public key.

* On startup, a client queries data from all relays it knows for all users it follows (for example, all updates from the last day), then displays that data to the user chronologically.

* A "post" can contain any kind of structured data, but the most used ones are going to find their way into the standard so all clients and relays can handle them seamlessly.
